## <p align='left'/> INTRODUCTION </p>
This project is part of my coursework in the SkillHarvest Data Analysis Bootcamp, where I explored the employment outcomes of a recent survey of Bachelor's degree graduates in the United States. The dataset includes information such as gender, age, field of study, university name, placement status, salary upon placement, GPA, and years of experience. Using PowerBI, I conducted an in-depth analysis to understand factors influencing placement rates, compare placement outcomes across different universities and fields of study, and analyze the relationship between salary and academic performance. The project involved data exploration, visualization, creation, and insights generation to provide valuable insights into the employment landscape for Bachelor's degree graduates.
